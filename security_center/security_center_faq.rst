Security Center Frequently Asked Questions
==========================================

Q: How do I report a security issue in your infrastructure?
-----------------------------------------------------------
The Trusted Firmware instrastructure is hosted by Linaro so please follow the
`Linaro security policy <https://www.linaro.org/vdp>`__ (also referred to by
Linaro's `security.txt <https://www.linaro.org/.well-known/security.txt>`__).
Please read the FAQ there before reporting new issues.

Q: I found a security issue in product X, will you fix it?
----------------------------------------------------------
If the product uses source code from TrustedFirmware's open source projects as
is, then yes. Regardless, we always recommend to invoke the PSIRT team at the
company behind the product as well.

Q: Do you have a bug bounty program?
------------------------------------
TrustedFirmware does not currently operate a bug bounty program. All projects
within TrustedFirmware are Open Source and sustain their operations through
contributions from diverse entities, including companies, organizations,
individuals, researchers, freelancers and hobbyists. Some contribute
financially, while others provide engineering resources, hardware and
infrastructure. Due to all work being done in the open, we believe security
incident work should be treated the same, but of course with the difference
that reporting is following the process as described in the
:doc:`incident_handling_process`.

Q: I found a security issue, but will only let you know if you pay me.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Unfortunately, we are unable to handle requests like this. TrustedFirmware runs
open source projects as described in the previous question in this FAQ.
