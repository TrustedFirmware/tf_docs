# Trusted Firmware Documentation
This project is the home for all Trusted Firmware documentation that is not
included in any of the Trusted Firmware projects' documentation or directly
embedded within the http://trustedfirmware.org website.

Although GitHub renders `*.rst` files reasonably well, this documentation
should be rendered using Sphinx. The latest rendered version can be found at
https://trusted-firmware-docs.readthedocs.io.

## Building locally
This documentation can be built using the simple command `make html`. It has
been tested on Xubuntu LTS 22.04 using Sphinx 7.2.6.
